# predict-home-loan-sanction-amount

## Problem Statement

* Buying a house requires a lot of careful planning. Once we have finalized your budget and the house that we want to buy, we must ensure sufficient funds to pay the seller.

* With rising property rates, most people avail home loans to buy their dream houses. The bank only lends up to 80% of the total amount based on a person's finances (salary, outgoing expenses, existing loans, etc.). We will need to make the rest of the payment yourself after the bank tells you how much they can lend.

* We need to predicting loan amount that can be sanctioned to applicant based on available features.
